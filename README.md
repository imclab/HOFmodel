This is a small paper on fitting an MCMC model to MLB HOF voting data. This paper is generated 
using [knitr](http://yihui.name/knitr/) and meant to be fully reproducible. The csv files 
were cloned from [@cscheid](https://github.com/cscheid)'s
[mlb-hall-of-fame-voting](https://github.com/cscheid/mlb-hall-of-fame-voting?source=c) repo.

Update [1/5/2014]:
I fit a few simple models in R to predict the voting percentage of all the candidates on the 2014 HOF ballot. You can see the results here:

The short version is that the model predicts Maddux gets in with over 95% of the vote, and that Biggio has about a 40% chance of getting in (with a predicted vote percentage of about 74%, +/- 4%).
