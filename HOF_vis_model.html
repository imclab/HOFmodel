<div id="more-rules" class="slide section level1">
<h1>More Rules:</h1>
<ul>
<li>About 570 members (as of 2014) of the Baseball Writers Association of America (BBWAA) vote each year in December, with results announced in January</li>
<li>A player must be selected on at least 75% of the returned ballots to be inducted into the HOF that year.</li>
<li>In 1967 they started to enforce the rule that if you appear on less than 5% of ballots, you are permanently removed from future ballots.</li>
<li>A player may appear on a maximum of 15 ballots (i.e. consecutive years) before being permanently removed.</li>
<li>In a given year, each voter may vote for as few as 0 players, and as many as 10 players (where an average year's ballot contains about 40 players).</li>

<div id="some-statistics" class="slide section level1">
<h1>Some Statistics</h1>
<ol class='incremental'>
<li>
1936 was the first year of Hall of Fame voting
</li>
<li>
Five players were elected:
</li>
<li>

<pre><code>##   Year              Name Pos NumBallots Votes Percentage
## 1 1936           Ty Cobb  OF        226   222     98.20%
## 2 1936      Honus Wagner  SS        226   215     95.10%
## 3 1936         Babe Ruth  OF        226   215     95.10%
## 4 1936 Christy Mathewson   P        226   205     90.70%
## 5 1936    Walter Johnson   P        226   189     83.60%</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
From 1936 - 2014, 1089 unique players have appeared on the ballot
</li>
<li>
112 have been elected, 47 on their first ballot appearance (<em>not</em> Lou Gehrig, Cy Young, Warren Spahn)
</li>
<li>
Famously, no player has been unanimously elected.
</li>
<li>
We consider 1967 to be the first year of 'modern' HOF voting (when the 5% rule was established)
</li>

<div id="some-problems" class="slide section level1">
<h1>Some Problems:</h1>
<ol class='incremental' style='list-style-type:none'>
<li>
<p>Does it really take 15 years to decide?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The so-called 'morals' clause, rule 5 out of 9:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Voting: Voting shall be based upon the player's record, playing ability, integrity, sportsmanship, character, and contributions to the team(s) on which the player played.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>(from http://baseballhall.org/hall-famers/rules-election/BBWAA)</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p>The voters don't actively cover baseball!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Q: Does that mean some Hall of Fame voters donâ€™t even cover baseball any more?</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>A: Yes. The BBWAA trusts that its voters take their responsibility seriously, and even those honorary members who are no longer covering baseball do their due diligence to produce a thoughtful ballot.</p>
</blockquote>

<li>Will Leitch: &quot;Voter Fraud&quot; 11/14/2013, sportsonearth.com</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Stupid things are called out as stupid, and people try to figure out how to correct them. It's encouraging. It's kinda nice. And then there is Baseball Hall of Fame voting.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Jonathan Mahler: &quot;Kill The HOF Character Clause, For The Sake Of The Writers&quot;, 1/10/2013, deadspin.com</li>
<li>Deadspin offered to buy a vote in 2013, and mainstream journalist Dan Le Batard (Miami Herald) gave his vote to the website (for no money). He was banned for life from voting on future HOF ballots.</li>

<div id="my-thoughts" class="slide section level1">
<h1>My thoughts:</h1>
<ul>
<li>In a nutshell: the voting process is a phenomenon unto itself. It is not a yes-or-no question!</li>
<li>We might as well embrace this, and study it.</li>
<li>(Hasn't baseball always been famous for embracing the 'human element' of the game?)</li>

<pre style='white-space: pre-wrap'>
[1] For Batting Average, 2.5 points for each season over .300, 5.0 for over .350, 15 for over .400. Seasons are not double-counted. I require 100 games in a season to qualify for this bonus.
[2] For hits, 5 points for each season of 200 or more hits.
[3] 3 points for each season of 100 RBI's and 3 points for each season of 100 runs.
[4] 10 points for 50 home runs, 4 points for 40 HR, and 2 points for 30 HR.
[5] 2 points for 45 doubles and 1 point for 35 doubles.
[6] 8 points for each MVP award and 3 for each AllStar Game, and 1 point for a Rookie of the Year award.
[7] 2 points for a gold glove at C, SS, or 2B, and 1 point for any other gold glove.
[8] 6 points if they were the regular SS or C on a WS winning team, 5 points for 2B or CF, 3 for 3B, 2 for LF or RF, and 1 for 1B. I don't have the OF distribution, so I give 3 points for OF (requires at least 82 games as the position).
